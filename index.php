			<h3>Tailor your wear to the best</h3>
			<p>A great suit is the ultimate fashion statement for men, but it most certainly needs to be styled correctly. Nothing says disordered like a baggy suit, one that is ill-fitting or worse, a suit that features extra long trousers.</p>
			<p>It is important to find a tailor who not only understands the ins and outs of making a <a href="#">great suit</a> but one that also appreciates your personal preferences when it comes to tailoring. </p>
